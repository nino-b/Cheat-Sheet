## These are the questions we might ask during coding interviews to clarify the problem

#### Understanding the Problem

1. Can you clarify the expected input and output for this problem?
2. Is there a specific format in which the input will be provided and the output expected?
3. Are there any edge cases I should be particularly aware of?

#### Constraints and Specifications
1. What are the time and space complexity constraints?
2. Are there any specific memory usage considerations?
3. How large can the input data get?
4. Are there limits to the values of the input?

#### Expected Behavior
- What should the program do when it encounters invalid input?
- How should the solution handle edge cases like empty inputs, extremely large values, or negative numbers (if applicable)?
- Should the solution prioritize efficiency, readability, or extensibility?

#### Test Cases
- Could you provide a few examples of input/output pairs?
- Are there any specific test cases that you think are important to consider?

#### Environment and Tools
- What programming language should I use? Are there any specific language features or versions I should be aware of?
- Are there any libraries or frameworks that are off-limits or recommended for this solution?

#### Use Cases and Scenarios
- Can you describe a real-world scenario where this problem or its solution would be applicable?
- How is this problem relevant to the work your team does?

#### Performance and Optimization
- After achieving a correct solution, will we discuss potential optimizations?
- Is there a particular aspect of the solution (e.g., speed, memory usage) that is most important for this problem?

#### Follow-up and Extensions
- If I have additional time, are there extensions to the problem you would be interested in exploring?
- Are there known variations of this problem that might be useful to consider?

#### Clarifications on Restrictions
- Am I allowed to access the internet or any external resources for documentation or syntax clarification?
- Are there any specific coding styles or conventions you would prefer I follow?



#### Handling Invalid Inputs
- Clarification on invalid inputs: What constitutes invalid input for this problem? How should the program respond to itâ€”should it throw an error, return a specific value, or handle it gracefully in some other way?
- Type checking: Should the solution explicitly check for the correct data types, or is it safe to assume that the input will always be well-formed and of the expected type?

#### Edge Cases
- Empty inputs: How should the solution behave when given an empty input? This could be an empty string, an empty array, or any other data structure depending on the context of the problem.
- Extreme values: How should the program handle very large or very small inputs? Understanding the limits can help design a more robust solution.
Boundary conditions: What should the output be for the boundary values of the input domain? These are often sources of bugs if not handled properly.

#### Output Specifications
- Formatting of the output: Is there a specific format in which the output should be returned? For example, should numbers be rounded, or should strings follow a certain case or format?
Single vs. multiple outputs: Can there be multiple valid outputs for a given input? If so, is any specific output preferred, or should all possibilities be accounted for?
- Order of results: In problems where the solution involves a list or set of results, does the order matter? Should the results be sorted in a particular way?

#### Performance Expectations
- Efficiency considerations: Are there expectations regarding the time or space efficiency of the solution? In real-world applications, a solution that meets functional requirements but performs poorly under large-scale data might not be acceptable.
- Resource limitations: Are there any constraints on the use of external resources, such as file access, network calls, or database queries, within the solution?

#### Real-world Application
- Usability in context: How does this problem or its solution fit within a larger application or system? Understanding the real-world application can influence how you prioritize different aspects of the expected behavior.
- Scalability: If the solution is part of a larger system, how well does it need to scale? This can affect decisions on data structures, algorithms, and even the programming language.
